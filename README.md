# storybook-css-modules-example
'tis not working :)

1. Run `yarn install`
2. Run `yarn storybook`
3. On the Alert page in Storybook, the component is loaded but without any styling

PS: in .storybook/main.js I've left (commented out) a bunch of the messy code used while trying different solutions. Now it's just running the default setup.
